Super hero: Avengers, tt0848228, keywords plays a big part and super hero other than the avengers(spader man, x-man) are also in the list 

Mystery and drama: Seven, tt0114369
                   The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, tt0421715
               	   Both David Fincher mystery and drama, Seven recommendes serial killing and rouge cop, and Button finds romantic drama/fantasy 

Apocalyptic: King Kong, tt0360717 
             Gravity, tt1454468
             Both have Vionel Theme contribution.
             For King Kong the added forest feature finds more advanture in same scene(Jurassic park and world)
             For Gravity, keyword space and brightness also became a factor.

Arty-farty: Manhattan, tt0079522
            Vicky Cristina Barcelona, tt0497465
            Both Woody Allen dialogue centric romance/comedy, so a lot of woody allen films are recommended.
            But Vicky Cristina Barcelona has more features to match so other directors are also in the list.

Love story: Love actually, tt0314331
			Begin again, tt1980929
			For Love actually, good recommendation based on remantic comdey genre and feel good romance theme.
			The added features for Begin again like location and scene make genre less important and the system shows more serendipity.

Low attention: All-hat, tt0903131
			   Ida, tt2718492
			   Extreemly different to recommend due to the lack of information around the film(less famous casts and director) or too few people has viewed the content.
			   Scene information can be of great help to recommend movie, a open_country scene point to a western film style and RGB feature explains the color choice of the dirctor.
